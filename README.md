THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS AND PROCESS ARE FOLLOWED.....

You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains two methods: int divisorSum(int n) and int findFactorial(int n). You need to write a class called MyCalculator which implements the interface.
● divisorSum method just takes an integer as input and returns the sum of all its divisors.
For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, so divisorSum should return 12. The value of
n will be at most 100.

● findFactorial method takes an integer as input and returns its factorial value. Use
bigInteger library to perform this. (n<=50)
